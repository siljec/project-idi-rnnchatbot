calm down please _EOS_  what happening is the shell is interpretting your command _EOS_  so if you do this it will work: _EOS_  try my command line _EOS_  great. _EOS_ _EOT_ 
^^ _EOS_  is it working or are you just complaining abou the errors in the log file? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
composite and GLX cannot be enabled together _EOS_ _EOT_ 
should be in PS1 _EOS_ _EOT_ 
copy the one from /root then uncomment the bottom 3 lines, then run: source ~/.bashrc _EOS_ _EOT_ 
its told to start in ~/.bashrc   you may find one is there, just needs the lines uncommenting _EOS_ _EOT_ 
is the file there, you can run:    ls -a    to check _EOS_ _EOT_ 
mine's: andy:x:1000:1000:andy,,,:/home/andy:/bin/bash _EOS_ _EOT_ 
 you mean the rescue mode/recovery mode? where you get to a console/menu to do some things? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
 you get to the login/lightdm screen and what happens exactly? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
 go to the console, stop lightdm, (sudo service lightdm stop) and try 'startx' and look for error messages.   you could also try making a new user and see if the same issue happens to them. _EOS_ _EOT_ 
 at the console you cant login? _EOS_   alt-ctrl-f1 = console. :) _EOS_   there is a known issue in 12.04 where users cant login via lightdm, but guest can.. (i just installed gdm and i can login with it) _EOS_ _EOT_ 
ifconfig _EOS_ _EOT_ 
static or dhcp _EOS_ _EOT_ 
look at /etc/interface _EOS_ _EOT_ 
sorry look at /etc/network/interfaces _EOS_ _EOT_ 
i think you have to look in /proc _EOS_ _EOT_ 
not really, do a "sudo swapon -s" what does it show _EOS_ _EOT_ 
ok, that means you have a swap line in your /etc/fstab that points at /mnt/2048mb.swap, remove it _EOS_ _EOT_ 
look in the files /etc/fstab and remove that line _EOS_ _EOT_ 
or ignore my advice.....and do what you want _EOS_ _EOT_ 
what do are you doing normally when it crashes? _EOS_  uses firebug and web developer or some addon like that _EOS_ _EOT_ 
I don't know of one that will interface with iTunes _EOS_  there probably won't be one until Apple releases iTunes for Linux (heh. heh. heh.) _EOS_ _EOT_

"support file transfer" is too vague, transferring from what device to what device? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
gtkpod might be able to do that _EOS_ _EOT_

unfortunatly no, not until they fix it _EOS_ _EOT_ 
auto login to NASA or where? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
yeah.. so if I want to edit a .conf or something I don't have to go to terminal ... sudo nano blah blah _EOS_ _EOT_ 
i know... had the same prob on my laptop _EOS_ _EOT_ 
yeah, adding something to alsa-conf?.. thats what i did, worked on mine _EOS_ _EOT_ 
i had my sound working in alpha3...lol... just took a little googling _EOS_  not to mention, resorting to an old gutsy gibbon trick _EOS_ _EOT_ 
nope, was trying to get some info to give some suggestions _EOS_ _EOT_ 
well.. if the network manager is erroring out, maybe something got borked in the upgrade.. reinstall it... but it sounds like he tried that _EOS_ _EOT_ 
then check currently running apps, and see if there's two running, and kill one.. _EOS_ _EOT_ 
usually when you choose to reinstall, i believe it purges the old one _EOS_ _EOT_ 
samba is pretty easy.. _EOS_ _EOT_ 
hold on, i'll get you a link that will help a lot _EOS_ _EOT_ 
are the linux and windows OS's that need access to the shared folders, online at the same time? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
ok _EOS_  i used the first post in this thread... very simple w/ ubuntu 9.10   http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=202605 _EOS_ _EOT_ 
well, you _can_ edit it, but very few chances of getting it working _EOS_ _EOT_ 
with any text editor, but if you really want to see something, try with a bin editor _EOS_  what are you trying to do? Do you know what you are really going to do with a bin editor? you know machine code? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
so use what they told you, hexedit _EOS_  what do you think? _EOS_  just read the manual _EOS_ _EOT_ 
are you using windows? _EOS_  try in command line _EOS_ _EOT_ 
open terminal and tehn type the full path to the file _EOS_  there is your problem _EOS_  the .muh is probably a folder _EOS_ _EOT_ 
you should try the muh channel :P _EOS_ _EOT_

I gues you could disable all automatic updates from Software Sources, but do remember to check them annually yourself. _EOS_ _EOT_ 
not sure, haven't tested it ever _EOS_ _EOT_ 
because some driver/app in the stick is not in the final install? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
the proof that the gpu is/was good enough was it being seen while running off the live/stick, as to what driver you are missing i am clueless, can you do a side by side comparision? or at least get the logs for xorg while on stick and compare to the installed? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
comparing the two dirs/folders would not hurt either , /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ _EOS_ _EOT_ 
my bad then, i was looking at my setup on opensuse, the equiv must exist _EOS_ _EOT_ 
correct, not looking for xorg.conf, looking for a dir with some rules that are auto created at boot via udev(i think, not sure about that one) _EOS_ _EOT_

 ive noticed it taking a VERY long time also.. i think it may be hanging, OR you selected the clean free area option _EOS_ _EOT_ 
 its actually overwriting the free space to 'securely delete' things from how i read the tooltops _EOS_   i think that option should proberly be disabled by default. :) its a little over paranoid _EOS_ _EOT_

not sure if what im saying is correct but you must reconfigure Grub. _EOS_  point it to the right direction _EOS_ _EOT_ 
are you running these commands on a live cd? _EOS_ _EOT_ 
you need to run them on the broken grub install... _EOS_ _EOT_ 
you need to reboot and fix grub manually. not sure if thats your problem.. you should google your problems .. its impossible to know the solution.. sorry.. not that good. _EOS_ _EOT_

 if I wanted to do this as a batch how would I do it using mencoder?

my thoughts on the subject would be both checking the device itself i.e. catting the device and see if its producing output when you're not touching it, and also checking what kind of weird input devices are configured via your xorg.conf or xorg.log _EOS_ _EOT_ 
but as you mentioned this is a thinkpad and I know them well, it has a tracknav (two pointing devices) I know as they get old and dirty they tend to have these kinds of issues _EOS_ _EOT_ 
sounds like as I thought, something is wonky with the device itself.. either the connection is bad or its dirty..etc.. I frequently had problems with my trackpoint doing the moving to the side thing until I cleaned it real good and put a new rubber tip on it. never had the clicking issue though _EOS_ _EOT_ 
I'd move on to physical troubleshooting.. I'm a certified tech but its not really rocket science even if you aren't. Thinkpads have clearly marked screw holes on the bottom for which ones take off the keyboard to get in there and check the connections and for the most part those keyboards can be washed in the sink.. heh just gotta dry well before reconnecting _EOS_  often the ram sits right below the tracknav and that heat could've done damage as well.. depends on how old it is and how well taken care of _EOS_ _EOT_

also you can use brasero or any other burning program to create an iso _EOS_ _EOT_ 
no problem _EOS_ _EOT_ 
trinity-rescue-kit, is a distro designed specifically for your case (recovering/reseting win passwords) _EOS_  right click the .iso file and then click on "burn to CD" _EOS_  alternatively you can create a bootable USB flash memory (pendrive) with it. (system - admin - usb creator) _EOS_  open brasero, it will display 5 big buttons, pick the last one (burn image) _EOS_  brasero should work just fine; burning an iso file is not that hard; I also like gnomebaker more though (it plays a cool sound when it ends!) _EOS_  I personally help people "for fun", is better than just keeping my sit warm while I'm at work :) _EOS_ _EOT_

did u have a confusion about it, a queston or what? _EOS_  because a monitor physically connected works via hardware and some software, using a tv as a monitor is all software (unless its a monitor/tv that attaches via monitor cable) _EOS_  4 real, ure best option is to get out a real monitor, install, then install the tv/monitor _EOS_  maybe, _EOS_ _EOT_ 
in general with a large channel like #ubuntu you shouldn't split things up on multiple lines unless you're addressing someone _EOS_  no problem _EOS_  what is your question? _EOS_ _EOT_

Deleting the directory is what I would do if I was having problems with Do. Unless you really don't want to kill your history and settings. Also, I was wrong about the directory. Here is a list of gnome-do directories I found in my home folder: http://paste.ubuntu.com/425627/ _EOS_  to see any files that start with ".", you need to press Ctrl + H in the file manager, or use the "-a" option with ls if you are in the terminal _EOS_ _EOT_
